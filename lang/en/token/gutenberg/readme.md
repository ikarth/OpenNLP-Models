# NLP Tokenizing Training Dataset based on a Corpus drawn from Project Gutenberg

This is a training corpus generated from public domain texts curated by Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/)

Much of the SPLIT tagging was assembled automatically. Examining and improving the quality of the data is a priority.

## Please Contribute

You can help by checking and revising the text, adding more texts to the dataset, and using the resulting models in your projects.

Checking the model against known test data and documenting the result would be a good next step.
